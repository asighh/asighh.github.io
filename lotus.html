<p class="important">To create an illustration using a lotus flower pattern. </p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I had never used patterns or repetition before so this project allowed me to try something new. I wanted to think outside the box and force myself into a new element. This would also help me in other design aspects as repetition and patterns can be seen everywhere.

<h1>challenges:</h1>
<p class="important">The greatest challenge was seamlessly incorporating a lotus flower pattern into my artwork. </p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I had my initial goal but I didn’t know how I wanted to develop it into a complete idea. How do I use patterns?  What can I make with a lotus flower pattern? How do I use a pattern to create something greater than the sum of its parts? To answer these questions I decided to think about what a lotus flower means to me.

<h1>Process:</h1>
<p class="important">The process was smooth, I only had to rework my idea once. After the rework, the rest of the piece came together without issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>When I think of a lotus flower, I'm reminded of Asian culture, the color light pink, and water. Focusing on these three things my ideas began coming together. The Ying-yang symbol is a staple of Asian culture and it's very simple, I thought to somehow make the Ying-yang symbol with the lotus pattern. I initially wanted to create a bonsai tree out of lotus patterns and incorporate it into the Ying-yang symbol. Once I started I realized that it would have looked messy and complicated. Messy and complicated are feelings that contradict what I feel when I think of a lotus so I decided to scrap the bonsai idea. After playing with the lotus pattern and the Ying-yang symbol, I created a shape that reminded me of twin dragons. I colored the two dragons red and blue to keep with the theme of balance that comes from the Ying-yang symbol. The overall style of the drawing is made to look like an ink or water painting, falling in line with the initial ideas I had about what lotuses make me think of.

<h1>results:</h1>
<p class="important">The art piece was very successful, the different aspects of the piece came together nicely to paint a picture of balance.

<div class="depth">
<p>From this piece, I learned to take a step back and rework my ideas. I’ve gained a bit of experience working with rules that I set for myself. I wanted to create something with a lotus flower pattern and I achieved what I set out to do. I’d like to explore ink and water art styles more as this was my first time making something like this.
