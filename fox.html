<h1>challenges:</h1>
<p class="important">The hardest part of this illustration was the tails.


</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I kept changing how the tails looked because nothing was feeling right. I find it challenging to draw hair and add texture to my work. I also wanted to attempt to create a seductive character without showing skin or putting the character in a revealing pose.

<h1>Process:</h1>
<p class="important">My idea was fairly clear from the beginning, making the process very linear.

</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I wanted to create a magical character that also has seductive elements. I decided to create a fox girl because the word foxy came to mind and it aligned well with my criteria for the character. The only time I felt the process slow down was when I was working on the tails. I used reference images from Pinterest to help and inspire me. My greatest inspiration is the mythical creature known as the nine-tailed fox found in Chinese folklore.

<h1>results:</h1>
<p class="important">The illustration came out very pretty.
</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>This illustration is one of my favorites. I didn't have very deep concepts that I was trying to convey and it made it easier to just focus on drawing. My attempt at making a seductive character was fairly successful and the key to it was the eyes. So much of the character was hidden in an attempt to add mystery to her so the eyes are one of the only areas where a connection with her personality can be made.
