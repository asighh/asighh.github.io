<p>Hey, hey, who are you who am I, the man in the mirror that be staring in my eye. I said hey hey who are you who am I your tryna bring me down but I'm tryna get higher, burn with desire hot like a fire, we had some problems now we lit like a lighter said I’m a fighter an animal a tiger, the devil on my shoulder likes to talk make me tired. Ya, you a liar a schemer conniver, dont do it again, we trippin and trippin and trippin again, we said that we wanted to change but now we be stuck and we doing the same. What's the price for success what are we paying for fame, put in the work for the gain, just take what you’ve earned aint no reason for shame. Pick up the pace tie up your lace we making a change today stop looking for blame today stop looking for problems today. Today is the day we gon do it becoming productive my time never lose it living my life chasing joy I pursue it cause that's how you really should do it. don't get lost in the sauce, life’s coming fast if you’re ready or not don't focus on negative thoughts you’re digging a whole making it harder to start. So what are we doing today we making a change stay the same today? But I can't stay the same today cant be sticking in place blow my life but I can't blow my life away got too much potential can't lie today so what are we doing today, I'm taking the steps to my throne today.</p>
