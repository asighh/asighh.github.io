<p class="important">To create a merman character.

<p>I had asked a friend for ideas on what my next illustration should be and she told me I should make a male siren. I wasn’t sure what a siren was but after doing light research on it, it seemed like they are similar to mermaids however their defining feature is their voices. Depicting a beautiful voice through an illustration is somewhat difficult as sound can’t be seen. I decided to stray away from the initial idea of a siren and decided just make a merman.

<p class="important">A merman is not a new concept and there are a lot of references to be found. This cut the number of challenges I had to face down by a large margin.

<h1>Process:</h1>
<p class="important">I found reference images on Pinterest and worked from there.

<p>I also realized that the positioning of my previous characters was all forward-facing. I don’t think there is anything wrong with forward-facing characters but my end goal with every project is to improve and try new things. I had been doing the same thing for a while now so it was time to explore body positioning. When working on the hair I was inspired by the concept of long-flowing hair and an idea came to mind to make the hair flow like water. Also while working on the sketch for this illustration I got lost in my ideas and decided to create a female counterpart for this character. I made my merman represent the moon and started a second sketch for a female character that would represent the sun and would have elements of a bird. I gave her elements of a bird because birds and fishes reside in opposite domains. Balance is a theme that fascinates me and I find myself falling back on it frequently.

<p>I like how the hair turned out. Exploring positioning was a great decision for me because it gives me a new way to add emotion and personality to my characters. I learned a lot from this illustration and was immediately able to build on my thoughts by starting another sketch for a female counterpart right after finishing the sketch for the merman.
