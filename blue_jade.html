<h1>goal:</h1>
<p class="important">To create an ice princess that evokes a feeling of indifference. </p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I have always had an interest in fictional characters with mystical powers. I grew up watching anime and super hero movies. Eventually I gained the desire to create my own super hero protagonist. My goal for "blue jade" is to continue my character creation journey and create a character that has personality and depth. I want blue jade to be an indifferencent character who has locked away their emotions due to past trauma. To achieve this indifferent and solemn character I decided to lean towards a cold theme of ice and snow.</p>

<h1>challenges:</h1>
<p class="important">To put the emotions I want to convey into a visual illustration.</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I didnt really face many challenges. My biggest challenge would be the characters clothing. I had a hard time figuring put how I wanted her sweater to look. I had my idea and I had a fairly clear image in my head of what the outcome would be. Procreate, the application I used to create the piece didnt give me any heasaches either. I'm not an expert with procreate and I'm  constantly learing with every piece I make but I somewhat know how to get my Ideas out. Having an idea of what the end image would be, as well as my previouse experience with procreate made the blue jade progect progress smoothely. </p>

<h1>results:</h1>
<p class="important">I created a character thats more reserved than indifferent. </p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>The piece came out nicely. My only concern is that her head might come across as too small. In terms of the concept and the theme, it achieves that cold and detached ice princess that I wanted.</p>
