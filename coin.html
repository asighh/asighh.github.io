<h1>goal:</h1>
<p class="important">To create a character that has elements of greed.
 </p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I named the character yellow demon initially and he is supposed to be a part of “the cursed”, a group of characters that I have been working on to represent the seven deadly sins. They will appear on a narrative website I need to finish.

<h1>challenges:</h1>
<p class="important">The greatest challenge when creating this character was staying on track.

</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>When I started working on the character the image I had of him was not clear at all. Since it wasn't clear I was very uncertain of the decisions I was making.

<h1>Process:</h1>
<p class="important">The journey to make this character was muddled.

</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I used reference photos from Pinterest for inspiration and to help me with things I’ve never drawn before. When I started the character it was supposed to be about greed but along the way, a theme of balance took center stage. I decided to name the piece “same coin” because in my mind it connected, balance and greed. Balance because fire and water are opposites, two sides of the same coin, and greed because money and riches are one of the things people greed for the most.

<h1>results:</h1>
<p class="important">I’m happy with how the drawing itself turned out.</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>If I include the concepts that I was trying to convey with the drawing however I don't think I was very successful. This was a result of me being uncertain when I started the drawing and getting lost in the middle of the drawing trying to incorporate too many things. I still really like the finished product it is just a shame that the initial thoughts got lost along the way.
