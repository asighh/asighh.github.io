<h1>goal:</h1>
<p class="important">As an illustrator, my goal was to create cover art for my song “WONDERLAND”.
</p>

<p class="important">
As a songwriter and artist, my goal was to create a song that touches on my desire to escape.
</p>

</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>After completing the lyrics for the song I decided to create artwork for it. I wanted the artwork to tell the story of the song with one picture.  According to Fred R. Barnard (1921), “one picture is worth a thousand words.”

<h1>Lyrics:</h1>
<p class="important">- me

</p>
<div class="depth">
<p>“I see red, I see blue, I get sad, angry too. I remember I was down I was in a bad mood.”
</p>
</div>
<p class="important">- my brother
</p>
<div class="depth">
<p>“And I been in these dark days, nothing been healing the pain been talking to demons you know that they like me, that's, why I can't, get away and I’m stuck in this brain got these thoughts in my brain tryna make it to fame but I don't wanna change and aint it a shame how people gone switch up don't stay the same for real and I can't trust nobody but my gang for real I see how yall move you hiding fangs for real that's why you don't see me give no thanks for real and I won't let you get a single chance we been so hyped up we hanging from the ceiling fans I can see the writing you can tell its gods plan I done get excited watch me hit my little dance then its back to work and I dont need no helping hand”

</p>
<p class="important">- me
</p>

<div class="depth">
<p>
“My mind get dangerous, no you can't hang with us. Don't ask for trust cause I won't give it up. You want my love? But it's too late I’m psycho, you don't know a thing about me. So just leave me alone you talking a lot but I don't know what for. I hear the noise from your mouth it's invading my zone. you don't know a thing about me so just leave me alone. Do you feel what i feel to you bleed what I bleed do you see what I see cause I don't see color I only see shades my vision black and white in a daze. I see black I see white I remember the times I was down down bad exhausted lost counting my losses and all I really wanted was a trip to my perfect wonderland could call me wander man like where you going? Im going to a place with more emotions, where I can feel something without my worries growing. I need a break from all my problems all the struggles and the games, I need to stop and take a break before I jump into the flames, like leave me alone, I sad leave, I said leave me alone.”

<h1>Additional Thoughts:</h1>
<p class="important">“I don't see color I only see shades my vision black and white in a daze. I see black I see white I remember the times I was down down bad exhausted”.
</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I bring my vision back up again to emphasize how I perceive the world. In the beginning of the song I said I saw in red and blue but now at the end of the song I see in black and white because after feeling intense anger and sadness instead of dealing with those emotions, its easier to just cut them off. It also has a second meaning because before TV was in color it was in black and white and in the line I talk about remembering my past.

<h1>challenges:</h1>
<p class="important">In terms of writing lyrics, It’s not challenging because it's just the thoughts that have been on my mind put together rhythmically.

</p>
<p class="important">The main challenge was, using the words from the song to create a visual representation.

</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>The title of the song is, “wonderland”. I was set on creating some type of magical environment that could represent a wonderland. The issue was my lack of experience in drawing environments and architecture.

<h1>Process:</h1>
<p class="important"> The song was recorded on a website called Soundtrap.
 </p>

<p class="important"> The process was straightforward. I kept having ideas and building on them.
 </p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I did not have problems once I started. I had already been thinking about the concepts for a while. The lyrics in the song had been in my mind for a long time, allowing my ideas time to form. My thoughts kept flowing as I was working on the piece. There were two lines in the song that heavily influenced the art. One was, “I see red, I see blue, I get sad, angry too” the second one was, “I need a trip to my perfect wonderland, could call me wander man”. These two lines gave me a lot of room to create as they mean a lot to me. “I see red, I see blue, I get sad, angry too”, is about my negative emotions that are constantly tinting my perception of the world. It's hard to enjoy things when there’s a constant blue or red filter influencing your vision.  “I need a trip to my perfect wonderland, could call me wander man”, this line is about escaping from the problems in reality. One of my strengths or weaknesses is I overthink things a lot and I can get lost in my thoughts. My mind is both an escape and a cage, hence the isolation I created by putting the environment in a snow globe and in between two hands.

<h1>results:</h1>
<p class="important">The artwork was successful in creating an isolated wonderland that someone can escape to.
 </p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>I tried to incorporate the lyrics by putting the wonderland inside of an eye. Eyes are the windows to the soul and I wanted to tap into that thought by making this eye the window into wonderland. I also made it a circular shape to make someone think of a snow globe, to emphasize the isolated wonderland, inside its ecosystem. </p>
