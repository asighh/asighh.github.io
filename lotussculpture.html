<h1>goal:</h1>
<p class="important">To create a sculpture of a lotus.
 </p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>The lotus flower is my favotie because of it's surroundings. The flower floats on the water, proudly blooming without being planted into the dirt. For me the lotus symbolizes growth despite the lack of a foundation.

<p>Most of my time was spent experimenting and making mistakes. My greatest challenge was familiarizing myself with this new medium.

<p> The armature I made may have done more harm than good. It gave me a solid place to start the sculpture from but afterwards, it felt like it kept getting in the way.

<h1>Process:</h1>
<p class="important"> The process included a lot of kneading.

<p> My fands were becoming tired from all the kneading which isn't something I'm used to. There would also be points where I would get frustrated because I couldn't get the clay to form into the shape I wanted.

<h1>Process:</h1>
<p class="important"> I discovered a different way to make the petals.

</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p> I was originally just kneading and molding the clay into the shapes I wanted using my hands and the sculpting tools. The four base petals were made using this method which is why each of them came out looking fairly different, but then I had an idea. I rolled the clay into a ball, making a sphere and then by using one of the sculpting tools I split the sphere into different uniform sections. I used these sections to make the following petals.

<div class="imp">
<h1>results:</h1>
<p class="important">The sculpture didn't come out exactly how I envisioned it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="depth">
<p>
 However, I learned a lot. My first approach when sculpting was very much influenced by my experience drawing and illustrating. I treated the clay like my paper and used the sculpting tools like my pencil. This approach wasn't bad but when I tried a new idea and opened up to being a sculptor it was rewarding. Each art medium has advantages and disadvantages. Seeing what i could do with the clay and 3d art has given me an experience that 2d art can't.
